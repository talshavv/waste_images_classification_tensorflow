In this project, me and my fellow team mates Amelie Rosenstein and Mital Thombre created a model designed to classify waste images as Recyclable or Organic.

----Premise----

As of 2022 global recycling was only at 13%. Despite the fact that, machines can already define and recognize different sorts of waste at accuracies of more than 90%.

We wanted to use these capabilities, and leverage them to further increase global recycling rates. 

Therefore, we tried to built a model that can classify between different sorts of waste.


----How we did it----

We worked with a database of 22.000 pictures that were divided into organic and recyclable waste. 

The dataset we used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data

Then we used a CNN model. It's a type of deep-learning neural network, which is designed to process data.

It consists of multiple layers that learn features about the images and classify them.

With that CNN model we reached an accuracy of 92%.

That means we would be able to capture 92% of waste that needs to be recycled.


----Conclusions----

Due to the fact that our project and research were conducted in a limited-time environment there are more aspects that could be tested out. 

For example: 

* A different deep-learning architectures so that we find the optimal one for the task at hand

* A larger and even more comprehensive dataset to improve the accuracy and capacity of our model to sort the waste correctly.

* Further division into more precise waste classifications by material types (paper, plastic, glass etc).
